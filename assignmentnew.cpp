//Program Assignment Description
//Letâ€™s assume that you have some extra cash and you are interested to invest it. After
//making your initial inquiries, you decide to invest your money in a savings account with
//a fixed rate. However, you would like to know how many years it will take your initial
//investment to reach a target amount. For example, you would like to know how many
//years it would take 100 Euro to grow to 300 Euro at a yearly interest rate of 7.5%.
